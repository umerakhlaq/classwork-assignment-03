Text Truncation with "View More" and "View Less" Feature
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to truncate long text to a specified limit (200 characters) and allow users to expand or collapse the text using "View More" and "View Less" buttons. This feature is similar to what is commonly used in applications like Facebook and WhatsApp.

Features
Truncates text to 200 characters initially.
If the text is shorter than 200 characters, no buttons are displayed.
Clicking "View More" reveals the entire text.
Clicking "View Less" collapses the text back to its truncated form.
Technologies Used
HTML: For the basic structure of the project.
CSS: To style the buttons and text display.
JavaScript: To handle text truncation and manage button click events.
How It Works
Text Input: The user enters text into an input field.
Truncation Logic: If the text exceeds 200 characters, it is truncated, and a "View More" button is displayed.
Expand Text: Clicking the "View More" button displays the full text and changes the button to "View Less."
Collapse Text: Clicking "View Less" truncates the text again and changes the button back to "View More."
Setup Instructions
Download or clone the project files.
Open the index.html file in your browser.
Enter text in the input field to see the "View More" / "View Less" functionality in action.
